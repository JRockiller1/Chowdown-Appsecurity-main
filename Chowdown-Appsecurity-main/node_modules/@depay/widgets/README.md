## DePay Payments

DePay Payments allows you to accept and perform crypto payments.

### Preparation

In order to receive decentralized payments on any blockchain you need to have your own wallet on that particular blockchain first:

- [Create an Ethereum wallet](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/)
- [Create an BSC wallet](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/how-to-get-started-with-binance-smart-chain-bsc)
- [Create a Polygon wallet](https://wallet.polygon.technology/)

### Quick start

```
DePayWidgets.Payment({
  accept: [{
    blockchain: 'ethereum',
    amount: 20,
    token: '0xa0bEd124a09ac2Bd941b10349d8d224fe3c955eb',
    receiver: '0x4e260bB2b25EC6F3A59B478fCDe5eD5B8D783B02'
  }]
});
```

### Configuration

You need to pass a configuration object to `DePayWidgets.Payment` which needs to at least contain the `accept` field:

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({
  accept: [{
    blockchain: 'ethereum',
    amount: 20,
    token: '0xa0bEd124a09ac2Bd941b10349d8d224fe3c955eb',
    receiver: '0x4e260bB2b25EC6F3A59B478fCDe5eD5B8D783B02'
  }]
});
```

You can also accept multiple payments on multiple blockchains:

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({
  accept: [
    { // 20 USDT on ethereum
      blockchain: 'ethereum',
      amount: 20,
      token: '0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7',
      receiver: '0x4e260bB2b25EC6F3A59B478fCDe5eD5B8D783B02'
    },{ // 20 BUSD on bsc
      blockchain: 'bsc',
      amount: 20,
      token: '0xe9e7cea3dedca5984780bafc599bd69add087d56',
      receiver: '0x552C2a5a774CcaEeC036d41c983808E3c76477e6'
    },{ // 20 USDC on polygon
      blockchain: 'polygon',
      amount: 20,
      token: '0x2791bca1f2de4661ed88a30c99a7a9449aa84174',
      receiver: '0x552C2a5a774CcaEeC036d41c983808E3c76477e6'
    }
  ]
});
```

#### accept

`blockchain`

The blockchain you want to receive the payment on.

Currently supported:

- `ethereum`
- `bsc` (Binance Smart Chain)
- `polygon`

`token`

The address of the token you want to receive.

Use our [payment configurator](https://depay.com/documentation/payments#payment-configurator) in order to simplify configuring this.

`amount` (Optional)

The amount of tokens you want to receive. Needs to be passed as a human readable number e.g. `20`.

The `BigNumber` of that amount will be calculated internally including finding the right amount of decimals for the given token.
So please just pass the amount in a human readable form as Number/Decimal: e.g. `20` for 20 USDT or `20.25` etc.

If you do not pass an amount, the user will be able to select an amount within the widget.

`receiver`

The address receiving the payment. Always double check that you've set the right address.

#### amount

##### fixed currency amounts

If you want the widget to fix a payment amount in a currency, use `currency` and `fix`:

`currency`: 

Example (charge US$5.20):

```
{
  amount: {
    currency: 'USD',
    fix: 5.20
  }
}
```

Make sure to not pass any amounts to `accept` if you use fix currency amounts.

The widget will still display local currency conversions to users. If you want to change this see `currency` configuration.

##### amount selection (changable amounts)

When you want to control how the amount selection behaves, pass the `amount` configuration object,
alongside values for `start`, `min` and `step`.

`start`: The amount that is initially selected.

`min`: The minimum amount selectable.

`step`: The number by wich to increment/decremten changes to the amount.

#### fee

You can configure a fee which will be applied to every payment with it's own dedicated fee receiver address.

The fee will be taken from the target token and target amount (after swap, depending on your `accept` configuration).

`amount`: Either percentage (e.g. `5%`, or absolute amount as BigNumber string ('100000000000000000') or pure number (2.5)

`receiver`: The address that is supposed to receive the fee.

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({
  accept: [...],
  fee: {
    amount: '3%',
    receiver: '0x4e260bB2b25EC6F3A59B478fCDe5eD5B8D783B02'
  }
});
```

#### fromToken, fromAmount + toToken

In case where you want to configure payments based on the source token + amount, rather than target token and amount, you can pass `fromToken`, `fromAmount` and `toToken` to `accept`.

In those cases make sure to NOT configure `token` nor `amount`!

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({
  accept: [{
    blockchain: 'bsc',
    fromToken: '0xe9e7cea3dedca5984780bafc599bd69add087d56',
    fromAmount: 0.1,
    toToken: '0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE',
    receiver: '0x08B277154218CCF3380CAE48d630DA13462E3950'
  }]
});

// This will open a payment widget to send 0.1 BUSD to the receiver, converting it to BNB along the way.
```

#### preload

To optimize initialization speed of the Payment Widget you can preload payment routes as soon as you become aware of the users wallet address. 

Typically right after the users conncets his wallet, or in cases the user has his wallet already connected you can preload immediatelly:

```javascript
let address = '0x4aD374e0836c26BeC213a19D3e030F8b3A8AcDE4' // e.g. retrieve it right when you perform wallet connect

DePayWidgets.Payment.preload({
  account: address,
  accept: [
    {
      blockchain: 'ethereum',
      amount: 10,
      token: '0xa0bEd124a09ac2Bd941b10349d8d224fe3c955eb',
      receiver: '0x4e260bB2b25EC6F3A59B478fCDe5eD5B8D783B02'
    },{
      blockchain: 'bsc',
      amount: 10,
      token: '0xa0bEd124a09ac2Bd941b10349d8d224fe3c955eb',
      receiver: '0x4e260bB2b25EC6F3A59B478fCDe5eD5B8D783B02'
    }
  ]
});
```

#### track

`track`

Allows to track payment confirmation/validation via DePay API to trigger callbacks into your existing systems:

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({

  track: {
    endpoint: '/track/payments' // your endpoint to forward the payment tracking to the payments api
  }
})
```

Once a user clicks "Pay" in the widget, and before the transaction is handed over to the wallet, the widget will send a payment trace (without transaction_id) to the configured endpoint.

This is where the payment tracing starts:

```
POST /track/payments
BODY:
  {
    "blockchain": "ethereum",
    "sender": "0x769794c94e9f113e357023dab73e81dbd6db201c",
    "nonce": 103,
    "after_block": 13230369,
    "from_token": "0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48",
    "from_amount": "1100000000000000000",
    "from_decimals": 18,
    "to_token": "0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48",
    "to_amount": "1000000000000000000",
    "to_decimals": 18,
    "fee_amount": "100000000000000000"
  }
```

Once the payment has been submitted by the widget, it will call the configured endpoint again.

This is where the payment tracking starts:

```
POST /track/payments
BODY:
  {
    "blockchain": "ethereum",
    "transaction": "0x4311a9820195c2a5af99c45c72c88848ed403a4020863c913feed81d15855ae4",
    "sender": "0x769794c94e9f113e357023dab73e81dbd6db201c",
    "nonce": 103,
    "after_block": 13230369,
    "from_token": "0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48",
    "from_amount": "1100000000000000000",
    "from_decimals": 18,
    "to_token": "0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48",
    "to_amount": "1000000000000000000",
    "to_decimals": 18,
    "fee_amount": "100000000000000000"
  }
```

Alternatively you can pass a method to track that performs the tracking request to your backend if you need to handle the request yourself (e.g. to add additional headers etc.):

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({

  track: {
    method: async (payment)=>{
      let response = await fetch('/track/payments', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify(payment),
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json", "X-CSRF-TOKEN": document.querySelector('[name=csrf-token]').content }
      })
      if(response.status != 200) {
        throw 'TRACKING FAILED'
      }
    }
  }
})
```

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({

  track: {
    method: (payment)=>axios('/track/payments', payment)
  }
})
```

In case you pass a tracking method it needs to return a promise. 

If that promise resolves, the widget assumes the tracking initialization was successful. If the promise rejects it will retry the tracking initialization over and over again.

Make sure to evaluate within your tracking method if the response succeeded or not and throw an error accordingly.

Your endpoint also needs to make sure to forward this to the [payment tracking api](https://depay.com/documentation/api#payments).

Also make sure to add `token`, `amount` and `confirmations` when forwarding the request to the payments api.
Those values are supposed to be set by your backend not the widget nor the fronted because any user could set these values to their liking otherwise, having you confirm payment amounts and tokens that you didn't intend to receive!

Make sure you read the [Payment Tracking API](https://depay.com/documentation/api#payments) for further details on how to integrate payment tracking.

Payment tracking requests will be attempted indefinitely. After 2 minutes a warning dialog will be presented to users asking them to ensure an internet connection so that the payment tracking can be performed.

##### Asynchronous Validation

For user flows where you can release the user immediatelly, we recommend performing payment validation asynchronously as in certain situation in can take up to multiple minutes to validate a payment:

You can configure the widget to track/validate the payment asynchronously:

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({

  track: {
    endpoint: '/track',
    async: true
  }
})
```

Which will release the user right after the payment transaction has been confirmed on the user's machine.

It still tracks and validates the payment asynchronously (in the background) and calls back your endpoints as soon as it has been validated.

This allows you to release the user immediately, showing him some confirmation and reconfirming his payment in an asynchronous step (like a notification or email).

##### Polling

In order to ensure a 100% coverage that users are released and forwarded within your payment flow, you will need to implement polling in addition to tracking.

The `track.poll` configuration either takes an `enpoint` or a `method` (similiar to track itself).

It will use the endpoint or the method to request a release every 5 seconds.

You need to make sure to respond to this request with a status `404` in case the user is not to be released just yet (payment and processing on your side are not complete yet)
or `200` if the payment has been completed and the processing on your side is done and the user can be released and forwarded withing your payment flow.

In case you want to redirect the user to the next step in your system, the poll endpoint needs to respond with a body containing json like: `{ forward_to: 'https://example.com/next_step_url' }`.

It is not enough to rely on setting `forward_to` initially with the tracking request, you will also need to respond with `forward_to` when implementing polling
as the entire reason for polling is to cover cases where websockets fail and the initial `forward_to` can not be communicated to the client.

If you use a method for additional polling, make sure you return a promise. Polling will continue as long as you resolve this promise with anything that resolves to true:

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({

  track: {
    poll: {
      method: async (payment)=>{
        let response = await fetch('/payments/123/release', {
          method: 'POST',
          body: JSON.stringify(payment),
          headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json", "X-CSRF-TOKEN": document.querySelector('[name=csrf-token]').content }
        })
        if(response.status == 200) {
          let json = await response.json()
          return json // { "forward_to": "https://mywebsite.com/payments/123/confirmation" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({

  track: {
    poll: {
      method: async (payment)=>{
        let response = await axios('/payments/123/release', payment)
        return response // { "forward_to": "https://mywebsite.com/payments/123/confirmation" }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

#### connected

`connected`

A function that will be called once the user connects a wallet.

This function will be called with the connected wallet address as the main argument:

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({

  connected: (address)=> {
    // do something with the address
  }
})

```

#### closed

`closed`

A function that will be called once the user closes the widget (no matter if before or after the payment).

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({

  closed: ()=> {
    // do something if user closed the widget
  }
})

```

#### before

`before`

A function that will be called before the payment is handed over to the wallet.

Allows you to stop the payment if this methods returns false.

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({

  before: async (payment)=> {
    alert('Something went wrong')
    return false // stops payment
  }
})
```

#### sent

`sent`

A function that will be called once the payment has been sent to the network (but still needs to be mined/confirmed).

The widget will call this function with a transaction as single argument (see: [depay-web3-wallets](https://github.com/depayfi/depay-web3-wallets#transaction) for more details about the structure)

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({

  sent: (transaction)=> {
    // called when payment transaction has been sent to the network
  }
})
```

#### succeeded

`succeeded`

A function that will be called once the payment has succeeded on the network (checked client-side).

The widget will call this function passing a transaction as single argument (see: [depay-web3-wallets](https://github.com/depayfi/depay-web3-wallets#transaction) for more details)

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({

  succeeded: (transaction)=> {
    // called when payment transaction has been confirmed once by the network
  }
})
```

#### validated

`validated`

A function that will be called once the payment has been validated by DePay Apis (server-side).

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({

  validated: (successful)=> {
    // successful (true or false)
  }
})
```

#### failed

`failed`

A function that will be called if the payment execution failed on the blockchain (after it has been sent/submitted).

The widget will call this function passing a transaction as single argument (see: [depay-web3-wallets](https://github.com/depayfi/depay-web3-wallets#transaction) for more details)

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({

  failed: (transaction)=> {
    // called when payment transaction failed on the blockchain
    // handled by the widget, no need to display anything
  }
})
```

#### critical

`critical`

A function that will be called if the widget throws an critical internal error that it can't handle and display on it's own:

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({
  
  critical: (error)=> {
    // render and display the error with error.toString()
  }
})
```

#### error

`error`

A function that will be called if the widget throws an non-critical internal error that it can and will handle and display on it's own:

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({

  error: (error)=> {
    // maybe do some internal tracking with error.toString()
    // no need to display anything as widget takes care of displaying the error
  }
})
```

#### providers

Allows to set providers to be used for making RPC calls to the individiual blockchains:

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({

  providers: {
    ethereum: ['http://localhost:8545'],
    bsc: ['http://localhost:8545'],
    polygon: ['http://localhost:8545']
  }
})
```

#### currency

Allows you to enforce displayed local currency (instead of automatically detecting it):

```javascript

DePayWidgets.Payment({

  currency: 'USD'

})

```

#### whitelist

Allows only the configured tokens to be eligible as means of payment (from the sender):

```javacript
DePayWidgets.Payment({
  
  whitelist: {
    ethereum: [
      '0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE', // ETH
      '0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7', // USDT
      '0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f'  // DAI

    ]
  }

})

```

#### blacklist

Allows to blacklist tokens so that they will not be suggested as means of payment (from the sender):

```javacript
DePayWidgets.Payment({
  
  blacklist: {
    ethereum: [
      '0x82dfDB2ec1aa6003Ed4aCBa663403D7c2127Ff67',  // akSwap

    ]
  }
})
```

#### container

`container`

Allows you to pass a container element that is supposed to contain the widget:

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({
  container: document.getElementById('my-container')
})
```

Make sure to set the css value `position: relative;` for the container element. Otherwise it can not contain the widget.

React example:

```javascript
let CustomComponentWithWidget = (props)=>{
    let container = useRef()

    useEffect(()=>{
      if(container.current) {
        DePayWidgets.Payment({ ...defaultArguments, document,
          container: container.current
        })
      }
    }, [container])

    return(
      <div ref={container} style={{ position: 'relative', border: '1px solid black', width: "600px", height: "600px" }}></div>
    )
  }
```

#### style

`style`

Allows you to change the style of the widget.

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({
  style: {
    colors: {
      primary: '#ffd265',
      text: '#e1b64a',
      buttonText: '#000000',
      icons: '#ffd265'
    },
    fontFamily: '"Cardo", serif !important',
    css: `
      @import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cardo:wght@400;700&display=swap");

      .ReactDialogBackground {
        background: rgba(0,0,0,0.8);
      }
    `
  }
})
```

##### colors

`colors`

Allows you to set color values:

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({
  
  style: {
    colors: {
      primary: '#ffd265',
      text: '#ffd265',
      buttonText: '#000000',
      icons: '#ffd265'
    }
  }
})
```

##### fontFamily

`fontFamily`

Allows you to set the font-family:

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({
  
  style: {
    fontFamily: '"Cardo", serif !important'
  }
})
```

##### css

`css`

Allows you to inject CSS:

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({
  
  style: {
    css: `
      @import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cardo:wght@400;700&display=swap");

      .ReactDialogBackground {
        background: rgba(0,0,0,0.8);
      }
    `
  }
})
```

#### unmount

`unmount`

Allows you to unmount (the React safe way) the entire widget from the outside:

```javascript
let { unmount } = await DePayWidgets.Payment({})

unmount()
```

#### recover

`recover`

Allows you to recover a previous made payment. E.g. useful if you need to continue to show a pending payment progress if user rearrives or reloads a payment page:

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({
  recover: {
    blockchain: 'ethereum',
    transaction: '0x081ae81229b2c7df586835e9e4c16aa89f8a15dc118fac31b7521477c53ed2a9',
    sender: '0x317d875ca3b9f8d14f960486c0d1d1913be74e90',
    nonce: 2865,
    afterBlock: 14088130,
    token: '0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE',
    amount: 0.0001
  }
})

A recovered payment still results in a confirmed or failed payment, and also calls one of those callbacks also when created with recover.

```

#### closable

`closable`

Makes the widget unclosable:

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({
  closable: false
})

```

#### integration

`integration`

Labels payments to track them per integration.

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Payment({
  integration: 'fe690fbc-1740-4894-b12c-23a72abec54d'
})
```

## DePay Sales

DePay Sales allows you to sell tokens directly from your website or dApp with automatic any-to-any payment conversion (so people can use any token when buying your token directly off your website or dApp).

### Preparation

In order to sell tokens in a decentralized way, that token needs to have a liquidity pool on a decentralized exchange:

- [Create Uniswap v2 Liquidity Pool](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/v2/ETH)
- [Create Uniswap v2 Liquidity Pool (Polygon)](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/v2/ETH?chain=polygon)
- [Create Pancakeswap Liquidity Pool](https://pancakeswap.finance/add)

### Quick start

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Sale({
  sell: {
    'ethereum': '0xa0bEd124a09ac2Bd941b10349d8d224fe3c955eb'
  }
});
```

### Configuration

You need to pass a configuration object to `DePayWidgets.Sale` which needs to at least contain the `sell` field:

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Sale({
  sell: {
    'ethereum': '0xa0bEd124a09ac2Bd941b10349d8d224fe3c955eb'
  }
});
```

You can also sell on multiple blockchains:

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Sale({
  sell: {
    'ethereum': '0xa0bEd124a09ac2Bd941b10349d8d224fe3c955eb',
    'bsc': '0xa0bEd124a09ac2Bd941b10349d8d224fe3c955eb'
  }
});
```

#### sell

`"blockchain": "token"`

`blockchain`

Currently supported blockchains:

- `ethereum`

alongside values for `start`, `min` and `step`.

`start`: The amount that is initially selected.

`min`: The minimum amount selectable.

`step`: The number by wich to increment/decremten changes to the amount.

`token`: Set to `true` if you want amount selection to be denominated in the token you're selling, e.g.:

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Sale({
  sell: {...},
  amount: {
    token: true
  }
});
```

    // called when payment transaction has been confirmed once by the network
  }
});
```

#### failed

`failed`

A function that will be called if the payment execution failed on the blockchain (after it has been sent/submitted).

React example:

```javascript
let CustomComponentWithWidget = (props)=>{
    let container = useRef()

    useEffect(()=>{
      if(container.current) {
        DePayWidgets.Payment({ ...defaultArguments, document,
          container: container.current
        })
      }
    }, [container])

    return(
      <div ref={container} style={{ position: 'relative', border: '1px solid black', width: "600px", height: "600px" }}></div>
    )
  }
```

#### style

`style`

Allows you to change the style of the widget.

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Donation({
  
  style: {
    colors: {
      primary: '#ffd265',
      text: '#e1b64a',
      buttonText: '#000000',
      icons: '#ffd265'
    },
    fontFamily: '"Cardo", serif !important',
    css: `
      @import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cardo:wght@400;700&display=swap");

      .ReactDialogBackground {
        background: rgba(0,0,0,0.8);
      }
    `
  }
});
```

##### colors

`colors`

Allows you to set color values:

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Donation({
  
  style: {
    colors: {
      primary: '#ffd265',
      text: '#ffd265',
      buttonText: '#000000',
      icons: '#ffd265'
    }
  }
});
```

##### fontFamily

`fontFamily`

Allows you to set the font-family:

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Donation({
  
  style: {
    fontFamily: '"Cardo", serif !important'
  }
});
```

##### css

`css`

Allows you to inject CSS:

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Donation({
  
  style: {
    css: `
      @import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cardo:wght@400;700&display=swap");

      .ReactDialogBackground {
        background: rgba(0,0,0,0.8);
      }
    `
  }
});
```

#### unmount

`unmount`

Allows you to unmount (the React safe way) the entire widget from the outside:

```javascript
let { unmount } = await DePayWidgets.Donation({})

unmount()
```

#### closable

`closable`

Makes the widget unclosable:

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Donation({
  closable: false
})

```

#### integration

`integration`

Labels donations to track them per integration.

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Donation({
  integration: 'fe690fbc-1740-4894-b12c-23a72abec54d'
})
```

## DePay Connect

DePay Connect allows you to have your users connect their crypto wallet to your dApp or website.

Returns connected `account` and `wallet` in return. 

```javascript
let { account, wallet }  = await DePayWidgets.Connect()
```

See [depay-web3-wallets](https://github.com/depayfi/depay-web3-wallets) for more details about the returned `wallet`.

### Rejections

1. Rejects if user just closes the dialog without connecting any wallet:

```javascript

DePayWidgets.Connect().then(()=>{}).catch((error)=>{
  error // "USER_CLOSED_DIALOG"
})

```

## DePay Login

DePay Login allows you to perform web3 wallet logins with ease.

Returns `account` if succesfully signed and recovered log in message.

```javascript
let message = "Sign to login"
let account = await DePayWidgets.Login({ message })
```

Connects wallet and instructs connected wallet to sign `message`, afterwards sends `signature` and `message` to `POST /login` (or `endpoint` if defined):

```
POST /login
BODY
  {
    "message": "Sign to login",
    "signature": "0x123456" // raw signature
  }
```

The `/login` endpoint needs to recover the address for `message` and `signature`.

e.g. your backend could use node + ethers.js to recover the signature

```javascript
const ethers = require('ethers')
const hashedMessage = ethers.utils.hashMessage(inputs.message)
const address = ethers.utils.recoverAddress(hashedMessage, inputs.signature)
return address
```

make sure you return the recovered address back to the widget:

```
POST /login
RESPONSE
  "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045"
```


Which will resolve the `DePayWidgets.Login` request to the resolved account:

```javascript
account // 0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045
```

You can also pass a `recover` function that takes care of signature recovery:

```javascript
DePayWidgets.Login({ message, recover: ({ message, signature })=>{
    return new Promise((resolve, reject)=>{
      fetch('https://example.com/login', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({ message, signature })
      })
        .then((response)=>{
          if(response.status == 200) {
            response.text().then((account)=>{
              resolve(account)
            }).catch(reject)
          } else {
            response.text().then((text)=>{
              reject(text || 'Recovering login signature failed!')
            }).catch(reject)
          }
        })
    })
  }
})
```

### Rejections

1. Rejects if user just closes the dialog without connecting any wallet:

```javascript

DePayWidgets.Login().then(()=>{}).catch((error)=>{
  error // "USER_CLOSED_DIALOG"
})

```

## DePay Select

DePay Select widget allows you to open a dialog that allows you to select things like tokens, etc.

Resolves with what has been selected by the user:

```javascript
let token = await DePayWidgets.Select({ what: 'token' })

// token
// {
//   address: "0xa0bed124a09ac2bd941b10349d8d224fe3c955eb"
//   blockchain: "ethereum"
//   decimals: 18
//   logo: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trustwallet/assets/master/blockchains/ethereum/assets/0xa0bEd124a09ac2Bd941b10349d8d224fe3c955eb/logo.png"
//   name: "DePay"
//   symbol: "DEPAY",
//   routable: true // information if token is routable through DePay Payment router
// }
```

## Examples

### React

#### DePay Payments

```javascript

import React from 'react'
import DePayWidgets from '@depay/widgets'

export default (props)=>{

  let unmount

  const openPaymentWidget = async ()=>{
    (
      { unmount } = await DePayWidgets.Payment({...})
    )
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    return ()=>{
      // make sure an open widgets gets closed/unmounted as part of this component
      if(unmount) { unmount() }
    }
  }, [])

  return(
    <button onClick={ openPaymentWidget } type="button">
      Pay
    </button>
  )
}

```

## Web3 Payments

The future is [Web3 Payments](https://depay.com/web3-payments).

Blockchains hold the potential to faster, simpler and smarter payments.

Web3 Payments are borderless, peer-to-peer, and support multiple tokens and blockchains.

Accept any asset type that your customers already have in their wallet. [DePay](https://depay.com) is blockchain agnostic and can at any time be extended on any blockchain-specific plugin. Interoperability, scalability & flexibility are the cornerstones of our protocol. Accepting any asset that users already have in their wallets no matter which blockchain these are held on, reduces friction when performing decentralized payments.

### Chain Agnostic (Multichain)

Interoperability is the key principle on which our infrastructure is built. [DePay](https://depay.com) is extensible around any blockchain, ensuring a competitive cross-chain future.

### Permissionless

Interoperability is the key principle on which our infrastructure is built. [DePay](https://depay.com) is extensible around any blockchain, ensuring a competitive cross-chain future.

### Trustless

Most Web3 Payment providers & processors receive payments to wallets that they manage themselves. Only in a further intermediate step are the payments paid out to sellers. [DePay](https://depay.com) does not act as an intermediary. Every intermediate step is replaced by smart contracts which are connected to decentralized liquidity pools. As a result, trust is no longer required.

### Easy to use

Our ambition was to create an even easier user experience than you're used to from shopping in current non-crypto e-commerce stores. We think we've done a good job of that.

### Open Source

Feel free to use & contribute to our codebase at. We're happy to have you look under our hood. The [DePay](https://depay.com) protocol will always remain open source.

### Multichain

[DePay](https://depay.com) calculates payment routes on multiple blockchains simultaneously despite what your wallet is currently connected to. Our software automatically detects & switches the network if required.
